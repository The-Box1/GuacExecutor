# Guac

Source code for Guac
This version contains the script hub and checks my websites for updates on startup
However, due to some issues with Google Safesearch I have taken down these endpoints on my website and so this version is broken

Here is a link to a completely standalone version that will still automatically grab WRD's latest version on startup
The only changes made are the script hub is removed and nothing checks my website for updates:
